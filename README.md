# LimbCalc
Calculates approximate volumes of limbs given circumferential measurements every 4 units.
Created for my physical therapist for keeping track of swelling in limbs.
Should be pretty self explanitory to use, minimum of three measurements to get meaningful result
The green curves drawn aren't accurate to what the quadratic estimation is doing, JUCE just doesn't have utilities for drawing parabolas
Depends on the JUCE library
